String Handling:

- String internally is a char[]
e.g. String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

- String is a predefine class in java, so it has lot of predefine functions inside the class.
e.g uppercase, lowercase, indexof, split, length
- It is also treat like a Data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit
- String Objects are created in 2 ways:

1. String Literal Style
e.g. String name = "Ram";

2. String Object Style
e.g. String name = new String("Ram");

- String use String Pool
- String objects are immutable

Immutable - String doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or objects 
all the time.

String Buffer and String Builder- Mutuable - That doesn't create new objects.

- Capacity Cross-16
	(Old Capacity * 2) + 2
	(16 * 2) + 2 = 34 
	
-StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. 
-Two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.

-StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e thread safe.
-Two threads can call the  methods of StringBuilder simultaneously
